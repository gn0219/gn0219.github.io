  about: `I am a master's student at [KAIST ICLab](https://ic.kaist.ac.kr/, color=blue), advised by Prof. Uichin Lee.
  My research spans various areas of digital health â€” from modeling human states using multimodal data, to enhancing the quality of physiological signals, and designing evaluative tools.
  While the specific topics differ, they all share a common goal: leveraging everyday data and technology to support better health outcomes.
  Ultimately, I aim to help build systems that make digital health support more effective, interpretable, and adaptable across different contexts.
